# Design blog
Use any blogging software you like to get your design journal started. Your design journal functions as both a learning tool and a professional design document. Reflecting on your design process and integrating the readings will help with learning design concepts. Describing your design decisions will help the rest of us understand your product (i.e. e-learning module) when we review each other's work and provide feedback.

Your design blog is a public design document and we will all be able to access each others blogs via links that we share with each other.
