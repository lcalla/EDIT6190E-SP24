# Welcome to EDIT 6190 online.

Whether this is your first, fifth, or last online graduate course, I hope it will be enjoyable for you - and a little different from other classes you've taken. Design technology can be a challenging topic to teach online - but I'm looking forward to the opportunity to learn with you.

Our semester is divided into 5 sections. Each section will take between two and three weeks to complete (see schedule below). You will be expected to complete all tasks for a section before the next section is assigned. This format helps to keep you on track but leaves our course flexible enough so that you can work around other courses, jobs, families, internships, and other obligations. Please keep in mind that this is a self-directed online course so it is easy to put things off and get way behind. This is not the time to procrastinate!

If we were meeting face-to-face, we would meet twice a week for at least 2 1/2 hours and then you'd have several hours of work outside of class to complete each week. While we can certainly be more efficient in an online course, you will have to set aside several hours EACH WEEK, in order to keep up with this course. You will be overwhelmed quickly if you procrastinate. If you are not prepared to spend that amount of time, or if you were anticipating that an online course would involve less work than a face-to-face course, you may want to reevaluate your course plans. You will NOT be able to complete all of the tasks in a unit on the day before they are due.

This course is part of a series of master's-level courses that are designed to be like a design studio, where you'll be able to share your learning and design experiences with your classmates. In this course, you'll be learning about design thinking as well as how to design and develop interactive learning environments for projects that are meaningful to you.

While the main focus of this course is on design, you'll also be learning how to build an e-learning module. It's important that you give adequate attention to learning the software tools that you'll need to use for your project. As a software designer, it's always important to be learning new tools and skills. The specific tools you'll need to learn will depend on your project, and you'll be doing most of this learning independently using online resources like LinkedIn Learning (free access for UGA students). The main project for this course will be developing and delivering a module using Articulate Storyline.

I hope you're excited to get started! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

## How is the semester organized?

* A new set of tasks will be posted on this website Monday by noon when a new unit begins.
* Tasks are due at the end of the day Friday at the end of the unit (see schedule below).
* Graded tasks are returned no later than the Wednesday afternoon after a unit's due date, grades available in eLC.
* Course updates, etc. sent via email as needed, check email frequently M-F

## How are grades assigned?

I'll use eLC to post grades. Each task assigned will result in a grade in eLC. There are two types of grades: completion grades and rubric/checklist grades. Completion grades are exactly like they sound - do the work as described and receive full credit. Rubric/checklist grades will be graded based on your ability to create projects within rubric/checklist parameters. Each set of tasks will include a combination of both completion and rubric/checklist tasks. It will be very obvious which is which. Grades will be updated on Wednesdays (after a due date), assuming tasks are turned in on time.

## I'm excited you're here

I hope you're all excited to get started in this course on design. I want you all to succeed and get an A, and I know you're capable of achieving it with hard work and dedication.

Learning design and software can be a lot of fun, and I'm sure you'll enjoy using your creativity as you work on your projects. My goal for you is to learn to use Articulate Storyline, tap into your creative potential, and really understand the principles of design thinking.

This course is a great adventure, and I know you'll all do great if you stick with it and set aside time every few days to work on your projects. Let's make this semester a success together!
